## About

Adminator is a admin dashboard framework that reflects your database models. It is all batteries included and extremely customizable

### How it looks
<img src="./docs/demo.gif" title="Adminator Demo" width="100%">

### Motivation
There are lot of good internal dashboard tools out there, The ones bundled with your framework are usually good but not usually highly customizable so they usually dont end up in your clients hand. The good ones are paid for and the free version are usually heavily restricted and they usually require weeks to master with some techinical know-how of SQL and javascript

Adminator takes another approach to building internal apps by building all the features you will ever need based on the metadata of your database which you can also edit in the app and allowing you to toogle off the ones you dont need

### Why you should try Adminator
- It is free
- Easy to setup, You setup it all up literally as fast you can type your DB credentials
