### Motivation
There are plenty of admin projects out there usually free or paid.

The free ones are usually tied to a framework and all your experience with it is useless when you hop to your next shiny language. They are usually not aesthetically pleasing and always require a developer to make any change

The paid ones are usually good but very restricted as their free version are usually demo plans for you to get a taste of what they can do and you will have to get to the paywall to get to be usable for your day to day

The primary reason to build Hadmean was to build something that will be free and very usable and language agnostic
